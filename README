CREGFIX
=======

CREGFIX is a small program that works around an issue of many modern CSM BIOS
implementations where certain control register bits are left "dirty", thus causing
issues when trying to run legacy operating systems such as Microsoft Windows 9x
(see "While initializing device VCACHE: Windows protection error" issue).

This program can be built into a floppy disk image using "nasm":

  nasm cregfix.asm -fbin -o cregfix.img

but included in this repository is a prebuilt "cregfix.img" file.

Write this floppy disk image file to a USB stick or a real floppy disk using a
utility like "dd" or "cat".
On Windows, a utility such as Rufus (in dd mode!) or balenaEtcher should work.

The written disk can then be attached to the target PC and booted from and it will
chainload the first hard disk containing the operating system after sanitising the
control register bits.

If using a USB drive, make sure that the BIOS is emulating a floppy disk drive.

Make sure to set the BIOS to boot from the USB/floppy drive first.
